# Get Me Pizza

## Abstract

Hello there. Just fun project. ðŸ˜‚
I wanted to do some python and I had to order a pizza.

It's basically a simple script that is filtering menu from Garage Pizza (https://garagepizza.pl) 
based on my preferences.

## How to run

```python
$ python3 script.py
```

Sample output:

```bash
pizza_name: 1.   MALUCH
pizza_name: 13.   SANTA FE
pizza_name: 16.   LAMBO
pizza_name: 18.   COROLA
pizza_name: 21.   GARAGE 1
pizza_name: 22.   GARAGE 2
pizza_name: 23.   GARAGE 3
```
